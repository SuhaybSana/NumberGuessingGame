I just started programming 3 weeks ago and im happy to say i'v just completed 
my first project. This is intirely in python and I know its not the best way 
to program this game but this is made from everything I know. If you have any 
suggestions for this game please dont be afraid to inform me of them because
im always looking to learn more.
